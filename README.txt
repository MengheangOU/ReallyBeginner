HELLO EVERYONE!
I'M JUST A BEGINNER IN GITHUB.
Can you make a friendly cloning with me ?
You can clone my folder and then you have to copy 
HTML code form CODE.txt into your subline Text 
or Visual studio code and then turn it on in the 
browser you will see some require information.
So you can complete all the require information in 
that browser. I didn't link any more page yet so, if
you finish the completing means you done.
THANK YOU FOR FRIENDLY HELPING ME.
